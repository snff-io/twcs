Ridge fire/earth
Fire races across,
Earth's ridge, igniting night skies,
A blaze of glory.
Across the ridge, fire finds its path, a vivid testament to the dynamic interplay between earth and flame. As the night skies light up with the blaze, the land is transformed, both destroyer and creator in this spectacle. This fire, racing across the earth's backbone, speaks to the raw and untamed spirit of nature. It's a cycle of renewal, where from the ashes, new life will spring, born of the heat and the light. The ridge, illuminated in this blaze of glory, stands as a beacon of change, a symbol of nature's endless cycle of destruction and rebirth.

Shore earth/water
Waves kiss the shoreline,
Earth embraces water's touch,
Eternal dance bound.
At the edge where earth meets water, the shore becomes a witness to time's endless march. Here, waves gently caress the sand, in a tender gesture of arrival and departure. This is the place of meeting, of parting, and of the ceaseless interplay between land and sea. The shoreline, with its scattered shells and footprints, holds the memories of those who have come before, a testament to the fleeting nature of existence and the enduring call of the horizon.

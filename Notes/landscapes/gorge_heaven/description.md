Rain water/heaven
From heaven, rain falls,
Quenching earth's thirsting embrace,
Life blooms anew, blessed.
As if answering the earth's silent plea, the heavens open, releasing a gentle, nourishing rain that blankets the world below. This rain, a sacred bond between sky and land, brings with it the promise of renewal and growth. Each drop, a whisper of nature's resilience, feeds the rivers and lakes, and gives life to the dormant seeds waiting just beneath the soil. In this moment, the cycle of life is palpable, a testament to the enduring dance between the celestial and the terrestrial.

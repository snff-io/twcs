Mist heaven/water
Mist veils the dawn light,
Heaven's breath upon the sea,
Whispers merge with waves.
As dawn breaks, a delicate mist rises from the water, a soft embrace between heaven and earth. This ethereal veil blurs the line between the sea and the sky, creating a realm where light and shadow dance in harmony. The air, filled with the scent of salt and the whisper of distant waves, speaks of mysteries untold and journeys yet to embark upon. In this moment, the world seems suspended, caught between the ephemeral and the eternal, a testament to nature's delicate balance.

Gale wind/heaven
Gales roar high above,
Heaven's fury, unleashed might,
Wind's wild, untamed song.
In the realm where the heavens stir, the gale winds command the skies with unbridled might. This celestial tempest, a display of raw power and majesty, sweeps across the firmament, reshaping clouds and dictating the weather's whims. It is here, amidst the roaring expanse, that the wind sings its wild, untamed songâ€”a hymn to the forces that exist beyond the reach of mortals, reminding us of the vast, untouchable wilderness that the heavens hold, a realm of endless mystery and awe.

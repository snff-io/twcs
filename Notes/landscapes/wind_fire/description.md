Blaze wind/fire
Wind fans the flames,
A dance of fire in the air,
Unbridled, they soar.
As the wind sweeps through, it fans the flames into a fierce blaze, a vivid display of fire's unyielding power when met with the breath of the air. This spectacle, where wind and fire unite, is a testament to the wild, untamed spirit of nature. The air, filled with the scent of smoke and the warmth of the fire, carries the flames higher, spreading the dance across the sky. This interaction, a dynamic ballet of elements, symbolizes change, transformation, and the raw energy that propels life forward.

Avalanche heaven/wind
Wind's fury, heaven's cry,
Snow cascades, mountains sigh,
Avalanche's whisper.
The wind, in its fury, becomes heaven's cry as it sweeps down the mountain, gathering strength and voice before unleashing the snow in a thunderous avalanche. This phenomenon, a whisper turned roar, marks the intense dialogue between the elements. The mountain, stoic and ancient, releases its hold, allowing the snow to cascade down its slopes in a display of raw power and sublime beauty. The avalanche, while a force of destruction, also signifies renewal, clearing the old to make way for new growth. It's a testament to the dynamic relationship between heaven and earth, where the wind's cry and the mountain's sigh converge in a spectacular display of nature's cycle.

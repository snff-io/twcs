Storm water/thunder
Distant thunder roars,
Water dances on the skin,
Storm's breath, life ignites.
When the heavens roar and the skies darken, a primal energy courses through the air. It's in these moments that water and thunder converge, creating a symphony of power and renewal. Raindrops, charged with the force of the storm, caress the earth, reviving the parched land and awakening dormant seeds. This dance of elements, fierce yet nurturing, mirrors the tumultuous journey of growth and transformation that each soul undergoes, marked by moments of strife and serenity.

Roaring echoes reverberate through rugged terrain, as the thunder's proclamation illuminates the depths of the gorge in a celestial spectacle.

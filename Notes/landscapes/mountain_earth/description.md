Mesa mountain/earth
Mesa stands alone,
Ancient earth under blue skies,
Silent sentinel.
The mesa, an isolated mountain with steep walls and a flat top, stands as a silent sentinel under the vast expanse of blue skies. This ancient formation, carved by the forces of erosion over millennia, serves as a stark reminder of the earth's age and the slow, relentless power of nature. Surrounded by the flatness of the surrounding land, the mesa's presence is both imposing and majestic, offering a unique perspective on the landscape and a connection to the deep, geological history of our planet.

Tsunami fire/wind
Fire rides the wind's wave,
A tsunami of flames roars,
Nature's wrath unfurled.
As if conjured by the forces of nature itself, a tsunami of fire sweeps across the land, propelled by the relentless wind. This cataclysmic merger of fire and air creates a devastating spectacle, a wave of flames that devours everything in its path. The wind, not content to merely spread the fire, amplifies its fury, embodying nature's wrath in its most primal form. In the aftermath, the landscape is transformed, bearing the scars of this fierce encounter, a testament to the power of elemental forces in their most unbridled state.

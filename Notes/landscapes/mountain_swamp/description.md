Rapids mountain/swamp
From mountains high flow,
Swamp drinks the rapid's gift slow,
Union of extremes.
The rapids cascade from the mountain's snowy peaks, carving through the landscape until they reach the swamp, where the water's tumultuous journey slows to a serene meander. This confluence of mountain vigor and swamp stillness embodies a union of extremes, a meeting place of energies. The swamp, with its dense canopy and rich biodiversity, thrives on the nutrients brought down by the mountain's rapids, illustrating the interconnectedness of ecosystems and the balance of nature's cycle.

Ember fire/fire
Last ember's glow wanes,
Heartbeat of a fire's soul,
Whispers of ashes.
In the quiet aftermath of a blaze, the last ember glows like the beating heart of the fire itself. This solitary light, fading into the darkness, carries the essence of the flame's once mighty roar. It is a poignant reminder of the transient nature of existence, where every end is merely the prelude to a new beginning. The ember, with its soft, dying light, whispers tales of passion, destruction, and renewal, leaving behind a legacy of ashes from which new life will inevitably rise.

Gush heaven/mountain
Waterfalls from high,
Heaven's gift to mountain's base,
Nature's serenade.
From the heavens above to the mountain's base, water gushes down in a spectacular display of gravity and grace. This cascade, born from the clouds, travels earthward, nourishing every crevice and life form in its path. It's a serenade from the sky, a melody that speaks of the high places where air turns to water and the earth reaches upward to embrace it. This is where heaven and mountain meet, in the rush and roar of waterfalls, in a dance of mist and light, celebrating the abundance of life.

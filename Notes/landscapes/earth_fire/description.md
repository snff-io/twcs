Crest earth/fire
Crest aglow with fire,
Earth meets flame in warm embrace,
Renewal's promise.
At the crest, where earth and fire converge, there is a moment of extraordinary transformation. The land, touched by flame, glows with an otherworldly light, signaling both an end and a beginning. This is the cycle of fire, one that brings warmth and destruction in equal measure, yet always promises renewal. The fire cleanses, making way for new growth, for fresh starts. It's a dance of elements, a testament to resilience and rebirth, where the crest, bathed in the light of the fire, becomes a symbol of nature's perpetual motion towards renewal and life.

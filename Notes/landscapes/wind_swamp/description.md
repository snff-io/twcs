Iceberg wind/swamp
Iceberg in the mist,
Wind whispers through swamp's embrace,
Cold meets the marsh's breath.
In the heart of the swamp, an iceberg stands as an anomaly, brought by the wind's cold breath. This juxtaposition of ice within the warmth of the marsh creates a surreal landscape, where the air's chill whispers secrets to the water and the reeds. The presence of the iceberg in the swamp, a fusion of polar opposites, symbolizes the extraordinary encounters nature orchestrates, blending elements in unexpected ways to reveal the delicate balance and adaptability of ecosystems.

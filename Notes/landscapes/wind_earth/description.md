Breeze wind/earth
Gentle breeze whispers,
Earth's soft reply, leaves rustle,
Dialogue of peace.
The gentle breeze, a tender whisper across the landscape, caresses the earth with a lover's touch. It is in this soft exchange that the leaves find their voice, rustling in reply to the wind's call. This dialogue, subtle yet profound, speaks of peace and harmony, a reminder of the quiet moments that bind the fabric of the natural world. As the wind traverses the earth, it brings with it the breath of life, invigorating the land and all who dwell upon it, fostering a connection that is both ephemeral and eternal.

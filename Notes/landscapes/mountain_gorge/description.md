Cascade mountain/water
Streams carve through stone,
Mountain's heart feeds the river,
Nature's cycle flows.
Amidst towering peaks, where the air holds a chill and the silence speaks, water finds its path. It begins as a trickle, emerging from the mountain's heart, growing in strength as it carves through rock and forest alike. This cascade, a testament to the enduring power of nature, nourishes the land, connecting mountain to valley, earth to sea. It's a reminder of the intricate web of life, where each element supports the other, in a cycle that speaks of resilience and beauty.

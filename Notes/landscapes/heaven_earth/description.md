Sky heaven/earth
Sky bridges the gap,
Heaven and earth intertwined,
Infinite canvas.
The sky, a vast expanse stretching infinitely above, serves as the ultimate bridge between heaven and earth. It is here, in the boundless blues and the shifting clouds, that one can witness the artistry of the cosmos. This canvas, painted with the hues of dawn and dusk, invites contemplation and wonder, reminding us of the fleeting nature of time and the interconnectedness of all things. Under this celestial dome, we stand grounded on the earth yet reaching towards the heavens, a symbol of the human spirit's unyielding desire to explore and understand the infinite.

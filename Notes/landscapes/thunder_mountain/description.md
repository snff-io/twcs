Sinkhole thunder/mountain
Thunder rumbles deep,
Sinkhole yawns in mountain's keep,
Echoes bind the earth.
Beneath the mountain's rugged facade, a sinkhole opens, as if in response to the thunder's commanding voice. This deep chasm, formed by the earth's shifting whispers, resonates with the rumble of the sky, a symphony of natural forces at play. The mountain, with its peaks reaching for the heavens, and the sinkhole, a portal to the underworld, become a nexus where the elemental power of thunder binds the earth, illustrating the dynamic interplay between the surface and the depths, between creation and erosion.

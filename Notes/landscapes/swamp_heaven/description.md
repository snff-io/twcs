Flood swamp/heaven
Heaven weeps, swamp fills,
Waters blend, sky to earth spills,
Sacred exchange shared.
When the heavens open and weep upon the earth, the swamp becomes a sacred vessel for the sky's tears. This deluge from above transforms the swamp into a mirror of the heavens, where the boundaries between sky and earth blur in the flooded landscape. This exchange, where celestial waters meld with the terrestrial realm, is a poignant reminder of the cycles that govern natural life. It speaks to the sacredness of water as a life-giving force, and the swamp, in its receptivity, symbolizes the interconnectedness of all things, a place where heaven and earth intimately converge.

Veils of mist rise to meet the stars, as the murky depths of the swamp find solace in the embrace of celestial mist and ethereal light.

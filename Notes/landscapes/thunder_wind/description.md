Bog thunder/wind
Wind howls, thunder roars,
Bog echoes with the storm's cry,
Nature's fierce debate.
As the storm descends upon the bog, the howl of the wind and the roar of the thunder engage in a fierce debate, a contest of strength and will. The bog, with its ancient waters and dense foliage, becomes a witness to this elemental clash, echoing with the sounds of the storm's fury. This tumultuous exchange, where wind and thunder vie for dominance, underscores the raw power and the untamed spirit of the natural world. In the heart of the bog, the storm's cry tells a story of resilience, of nature asserting its presence and might against the silence of the marsh.

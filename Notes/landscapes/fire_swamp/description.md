Ripple fire/swamp
Fire in the swamp,
Ripples through the fog and reeds,
A silent witness.
In the heart of the swamp, fire flickers, casting light over the water and wetlands. This rare occurrence, where flame meets the dense fog and thick reeds, creates a scene of stark contrasts and haunting beauty. The fire's glow, rippling through the fog, becomes a silent witness to the resilience of the swamp, its ability to harbor life and death in equal measure. This moment, where fire gently touches the swamp without consuming it, speaks to the delicate balance of nature, the cycle of life and renewal that persists in even the most unexpected places.

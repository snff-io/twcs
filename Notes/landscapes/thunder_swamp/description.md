Tundra thunder/swamp
Thunder over tundra,
Swamp beneath, ice-bound and still,
Echoes of old storms.
In the heart of the tundra, where the ice meets the swamp's silent, frozen embrace, thunder rolls across the sky, a stark contrast to the stillness below. This sound, rich with the echoes of ancient storms, tells the story of a landscape caught between seasons, where life persists under the harshest conditions. The swamp, locked in ice, and the thunder, free above, create a dialogue between the sky and the earth, highlighting the resilience and adaptability of nature in the face of the eternal cycle of freezing and thawing.

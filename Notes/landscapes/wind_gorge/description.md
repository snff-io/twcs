Geyser wind/water
Steam rises, wind's touch,
Geyser's breath, earth and air's clutch,
Force of nature, pure.
At the point where the earth's heated breath meets the touch of the wind, geysers erupt in a spectacular display of nature's force. This interaction between wind and water, air and earth, creates a moment of pure energy, as steam is thrust upwards, painting the sky with the power of the underground. The geyser, a natural spectacle, is a reminder of the planet's living, breathing core, where the elements meet and mingle in an endless dance of creation and destruction, a symbol of nature's untamed and pure force.

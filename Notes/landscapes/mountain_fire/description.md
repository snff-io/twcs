Volcano mountain/fire
Volcano's heart stirs,
Fire births earth, creation's might,
Mountain's fiery song.
Beneath the calm exterior of the mountain lies a heart of fire, a volcano that holds the power of creation within its depths. When it stirs, it speaks of the earth's raw energy, birthing new land in a display of fiery might. This process, as ancient as the planet itself, is a potent reminder of the dynamic forces that shape our world. The volcano's song, a symphony of fire and earth, tells a story of destruction and renewal, of the enduring cycle of life that continues beneath our feet.

Savanna wind/mountain
Wind sweeps savanna,
Mountain shadows stretch at dawn,
Earth's breath, wild and free.
The wind, a constant traveler across the savanna, whispers tales of distant lands to the stoic mountains at its edge. As dawn breaks, the shadows of these ancient sentinels stretch across the open plains, marking the passage of time in a land where the earth breathes free. This landscape, shaped by the wind's relentless passage and the mountain's unyielding presence, is a testament to the wild spirit that thrives in the harmony of contrasts, where the savanna's vast expanse meets the vertical majesty of the earth.

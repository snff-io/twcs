Inferno fire/heaven
Inferno's rage burns,
Heaven's gates challenge the blaze,
A duel of extremes.

The sky, painted with the vibrant oranges, reds, and yellows of the blaze, mirrors the inferno's intense heat and unbridled power. It is in this moment of extreme confrontation that the delicate balance between destruction and beauty becomes most apparent, reminding us of the potent forces that govern our existence.

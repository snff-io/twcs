Peak thunder/heaven
Thunder claps on high,
Mountain peak meets stormy sky,
Heaven's voice, earthbound.
At the very peak, where the mountain pierces the belly of the sky, thunder finds a voice. It's here that heaven and earth collide, in a tumultuous embrace of storm and stone. The peak, shrouded in clouds and the electric charge of the air, becomes a conductor for the symphony of the skies. This is not just a meeting place but a battleground, where the forces of nature engage in their eternal dialogue. The sound of thunder, heaven's voice, is rendered earthbound, a reminder of the awe-inspiring power that shapes our world.

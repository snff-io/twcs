Waterfall fire/mountain
Firefall lights the night,
Mountain weeps flames, beauty bright,
Nature's spectacle.
In a rare and mesmerizing event, a waterfall of fire cascades down the mountain's flank, illuminated against the night sky. This 'firefall,' a natural illusion created by the setting sun striking a waterfall at just the right angle, transforms the liquid cascade into a river of flame. The mountain, traditionally a symbol of stability and permanence, becomes the stage for a fleeting moment of extraordinary beauty. It's a spectacle that merges the elements of fire and water in a display of nature's artistry, a reminder of the ephemeral beauty that exists in the interplay of light, water, and earth.

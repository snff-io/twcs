Gust swamp/mountain
Gusts sweep o'er swamp to peak,
Mountain's breath, swamp's murmur meet,
Dance of air and earth.
From the depths of the swamp to the heights of the mountain, the gust carries the essence of both worlds. It whispers secrets from the marshland, carrying them up to the very peaks where the earth touches the sky. This journey of the wind, a bridge between the swamp's deep mysteries and the mountain's stoic majesty, is a dance of air and earth. It speaks to the interconnectedness of all things, where the breath of the land and the sigh of the water converge in a perpetual exchange of life and energy.

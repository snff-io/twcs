Lightning fire/thunder
Flash ignites the night,
Thunder applauds lightning's dance,
Nature's raw power.
In the heart of the storm, lightning carves the sky with fire, a brilliant display of nature's untamed force. Thunder follows, a resonant applause that shakes the earth, celebrating the lightning's ephemeral dance. This spectacle of fire and sound, of light and echo, embodies the raw power and majesty of the natural world. It is a reminder of the delicate balance between destruction and creation, a display of energy that both terrifies and mesmerizes, illustrating the dynamic interplay between the elements.

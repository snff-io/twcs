Fen swamp/thunder
Thunder over fen,
Nature's heartbeat, loud and clear,
Swamp whispers secrets.
As thunder rolls over the swamp, each rumble is like the heartbeat of the earth, resonant and powerful. The fen, with its dense vegetation and murky waters, listens in a hushed reverence. This is where the raw energy of the storm meets the tranquil stillness of the swamp, creating a moment of unparalleled intensity. The air, heavy with the scent of wet earth and fresh rain, carries the secrets of the swamp, whispered among the reeds and willows, a testament to the enduring dance between the fury of the skies and the quiet wisdom of the earth.

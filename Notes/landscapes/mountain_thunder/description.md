Marsh mountain/thunder
Thunder echoes 'round,
Marsh and mountain, meeting grounds,
Storm's ancient dialogue.
In the liminal space where marsh meets mountain, the echo of thunder creates a dialogue that resonates through time. This landscape, marked by the soft, water-logged earth of the marsh and the stoic, rising forms of the mountains, serves as the meeting ground for the elements. The storm, with its thunderous voice, speaks of ancient forces at play, reminding us of the enduring cycle of weather that shapes and redefines the natural world. Here, in the clash and confluence of water and stone, the storm narrates the ongoing story of nature's resilience and adaptability.

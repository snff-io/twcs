Steam wind/thunder
Steam rises, wind calls,
Thunder answers, power sprawls,
Nature's might, unfurled.
As the wind sweeps across the land, it carries with it the warmth of the earth, manifesting as rising steam. This natural phenomenon becomes the prelude to a greater spectacle when thunder rolls across the skies, a deep, resonant reply to the wind's call. The interaction between wind, thunder, and the steam rising from the earth showcases nature's raw might and its intricate dynamics. It's a dance of elements, each with its own power, coming together in a display of force and beauty, the essence of nature's unfurled might.
